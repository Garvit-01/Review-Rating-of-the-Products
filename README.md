Jupyter Notebooks and Python 

# Overview:
 Train and Test dataset are present and by training model with the [Train_Data.csv](https://github.com/Garvit-01/Review-Rating-of-the-Products/blob/main/Train_Data.csv) we have to predict the star rating of the [Test_Data.csv](https://github.com/Garvit-01/Review-Rating-of-the-Products/blob/main/Test_Data.csv)
and I have printed only the results that is star rating in a new CSV file called [prediction.csv](https://github.com/Garvit-01/Review-Rating-of-the-Products/blob/main/predictions.csv)
